# Even or Odd Number Checker

This Dart program categorizes a list of numbers entered by the user as either **even** or **odd**. It demonstrates the use of **user input**, **for-loops**, and **switch-case statements**.

## Features

- Prompts the user to input a list of numbers separated by commas (`,`).
- Parses the input string into a list of integers.
- Iterates through the list and determines whether each number is even or odd using a `switch` statement.
- Displays the result for each number.
